Q1: What is DevOps:

DevOps is a combination of practices and tools that allow a business to be able to deliver applications and services at high velocity. This means improving, evolving iterations at a faster pace, in comparison to the traditional software development and management process. DevOps engineers work in a single team, from an entire application lifecycle; development and test to deployment to operations. This means multiple skills are exercised, not specific to one single function. 

Why DevOps:

It is a culture and set of processes, bringing deployment and operations teams together to complete software deployment. 

- It allows reduced deployment failures, rollbacks and time to recover. In other words, DevOps promote more frequent code releases, it's easier to spot code defects. Agile programming principles are also implemented for collaboration and modular programming. Rollbacks are easier to manage.

- Improved communication and collaboration - combined teams are more productive, DevOps improves the software deployment culture. Culture is focused on performance rather than individual goals. It’s no longer for the application to be handed over to operations and waiting to see what happens. Operations doesn’t need to wait for a different team to troubleshoot and fix a problem. The process becomes increasingly seamless as all individuals work toward a common goal.

- Increased efficiencies - helps speed the development process and make it less prone to error. DevOps tasks can be automated, continuous integration servers automate the process of testing code. Software engineers can then focus on completing tasks that cannot be automated.

Challenges of DevOps:

- Blending multiple different people to work together - multiple people working on software developments can cause havoc and multiple iterations of development can occur. 

- Integrating multiple tools and make sure they work together in a iterative and continuous manner to make testing and deployment easier.   

- Moving to microservices architecture means engineers must have foundations of continuous delivery, configuration management, automation in place to withstand the enhanced operational workloads. 

- Shortage of tool knowledge - getting used to latest tools is often a difficult job, especially architecture based on cloud and on-premises during the process. This leads to organisations making faulty choices of tools, hinging their technical vision. 

- Continuous integration - This can be problematic because some tools could belong to various different domains on one common platform. 

Benefits of DevOps:

- Faster delivery time: Using the agile methodology; automation, continous delivery and quick feedback cycle is implemented to make the software development process faster and more efficient. DevOps utilizes automation to ensure a smooth flow of the SDLC. The collaborative culture offers quick and continous feedback, promoting multiple iterations of software development. 

- High collaboration between teams (Business/Dev/Ops): DevOps  is all about mutual collaboration, communication, and integration within an IT organization. All team members, together, are responsible for meeting the quality and timelines of deliverables. 

- Greater customer experiences: With DevOps, organizations can improve their deployment frequency by 200x, recovery times by 24x, and lower change failure rates by 3x. By automating the majority of processes, it becomes possible to ensure the reliability and stability of an application after every new release. 

- Early defect detection: The collaborative DevOps environment can share their knowledge across the teams. The automated, continuous monitoring and continuous testing of the code help improve the overall build quality. Working in teams allows defects to be detected early and resolved as soon as possible.
